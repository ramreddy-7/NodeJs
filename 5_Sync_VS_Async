             synchronus 
 
The synchronous APIs block runs the Node Js event loop and further execution
until the operation is complete.
Exceptions are thrown immediately using try... catch..... block.

Synchronous is a blocking architecture , so the excecution of each operation
depends the one before it.

In synchronous whatever statements we print they execute line by line..
