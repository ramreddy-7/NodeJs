1 . Node js is a Async language .. and Single Threaded...

     Run first script , Run second script(Complex data).
     It will not wait to finish second script 
     Run third script.


2 . We cant access node js folders from outside drives like c drive,d drive etc..
    Because it is a Web server .

3 .  Buffer : Buffer is a way to store and manipulate binary data in node JS.

4 . Synchronous : In Synchronous tasks are performed one at time.                After completion of previous task only next task is excecuted.

    Asynchronous :In Asnchronous if complex task is in first it not wait
 for that task to excecute it goes for next task to excecute.

5 . How Node JS works :

        (Event Loop)

     i) Call Stack
     ii) Node API
     iii) Call Back Queue

I) Call Stack : JavaScript uses a Call Stack to track the functions in a program.
All the functions which we are gonna excecuted track by call stack .It works 
on the LIFO principle.It means the most recently called functions will be excecuted first.

II) Node API : Node API is a tool kit .It acts an intermediate between 
C/C++ code and Node Javascript engine .
Whenever Call Stack track the complex functions like callbacks it push to Node
API . in node API it complete its task and it send to call Back Queue.

III) Call Back Queue : The Call BAck Queue is all the call back functions that 
are ready to fired . We move all functions from Node API to call Back Queue.
Now the call Back queue is where our call back functions will wait .they need
to wait for the Call Stack is empty. After call stack gets empty th first 
function from queue will push into Call Stack . Again call stack perfrom its
operation
